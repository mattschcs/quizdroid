# QuizDroid (Network)

An application that will allow users to take multiple-choice quizzes

now we will download the topics and questions from a server

## Tasks:

- When the application fires up, it should, as a background operation, attempt to download a JSON file containing the questions from the server. (This doesn't need to happen more than once, when the app starts up.) For now, pop a Toast message displaying the URL that will eventually be hit. Make sure this URL is what's defined in the Preferences.

- The background operation should now attempt to download the JSON file specified in the Preferences URL. Save this data to a local file as questions.json. Make sure that this file always remains in a good state--if the download fails or is interrupted, the previous file should remain in place.

- If I am currently offline (in Airplane mode or in a no-bars area) the application should display a message telling me I have no access to the Internet. If I am in airplane mode, it should ask if I want to turn airplane mode off and take me to the Settings activity to do so. If I simply have no signal, it should just punt gracefully with a nice error message.

- If the download of the questions fails, the application should tell me and ask if I want to retry or quit the application and try again later.
